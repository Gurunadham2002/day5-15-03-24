            Nature’s archive comprises all the content published since the journal’s launch in 1869; 
            it includes some images, articles and language that by twenty-first-century standards are offensive and harmful,
            including sexist, racist and other discriminatory content. This content does not represent Nature’s current values and would be unacceptable to publish today.
            We have not sought to suppress it because it is part of the scientific and historical record, 
            and so should remain available for scholars now and in the future. 
            Nature is committed to making the changes necessary to ensure that it learns from its past and creates a publication that champions science for everyone.

            The history of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir is centuries-old. 
            The temple is built on the site believed to be the birthplace of Lord Ram, 
            one of the most revered Hindu deities. The temple was demolished by the Mughal emperor Babur in the 16th century and a mosque was built in its place. 
            The mosque, known as the Babri Masjid, stood on the site for centuries until it was demolished in 1992 by Hindu nationalists, 
            triggering widespread violence and communal tensions in the country.
            The Ayodhya dispute has been a contentious issue in Indian politics for decades. 
            The dispute revolved around the ownership of the site where the Babri Masjid stood and whether it was the birthplace of Lord Ram.

            The mention of Kerala in the Indian Puranas, and in the epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata is a testimony to its existence since the ancient period. 
            Old timers refer to it as ‘Parasurama’s Kerala because it is said that avatar of Lord Vishnu, Parasurama, 
            hived land out of the ocean which was created to be Kerala.
            The history of Kerala can be traced back to 4000 B.C
            and Sangham period in ancient Kerala history plays an important role as it marks the beginning of the Christian era.
            Cheraman Perumal and Kulasekara Alwar ruled during this period but later renounced their thrones. 
            The next period in Kerala history was of Kulasekara Empire that lasted for about 3 centuries.

            Biryani is an evergreen classic that really needs no introduction. 
            India offers so much on its culinary platter but the one dish Indians unanimously love indulging in is the mouth-watering biryani. 
            With local and hyperlocal variations having evolved into distinctive styles of biryanis, 
            one is spoilt for options when it comes to experiencing this melting pot of flavours.
            So if you are a die-hard fan of this delicious dish, 
            take things up a notch and tease your taste buds a little more with the story of what makes biryani so extraordinary.
            Though it may appear to be a dish indigenous to  India, in reality, the dish originated quite far away. 
            Biryani is derived from the Persian word Birian, which means ‘fried before cooking’ and  Birinj, the Persian word for rice.

            Legend has all sorts of fanciful stories about Marco Polo bringing ice cream from China and Catherine de’ Medici 
            introducing it to France and King Charles I having his own personal ice cream maker; 
            all wonderful stories, but sadly there is not a scrap of historic evidence to back up any of these legends. 
            Marco Polo didn’t introduce either ice cream or pasta to Europe and worse still, he probably never even went to China. 
            Most of these myths seem to have been introduced by the Victorians.
            The earliest evidence of anything approaching ice cream being made was in China in the Tang period (A.D. 618-907). 
            Buffalo, cows’ and goats’ milk was heated and allowed to ferment.

            The 1901 Mercedes, designed by Wilhelm Maybach for Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft, 
            deserves credit for being the first modern motorcar in all essentials.
            Its thirty-five-horsepower engine weighed only fourteen pounds per horsepower, 
            and it achieved a top speed of fifty-three miles per hour. By 1909, 
            with the most integrated automobile factory in Europe, Daimler employed some seventeen hundred workers to produce fewer than a thousand cars per year.
            Nothing illustrates the superiority of European design better than the sharp contrast between this first Mercedes model and Ransom E. 
            Olds‘ 1901-1906 one-cylinder, three-horsepower, tiller-steered, 
            curved-dash Oldsmobile, which was merely a motorized horse buggy.
